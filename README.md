Hi! This is my frontend task for Ntropy. This is a simple image viewing website that is responsive. Images are already pre-loaded, so I chose to display those images using React. In addition I added some functionality, allowing the user to flip through images. I added a navbar too, but be aware that for now it is simply cosmetic (although it can be developed further to be used by a user).

To get started:
  - npm install
  - npm run start:dev
  - Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ on your browser.


As you may be able to tell, as of right now this is a full stack application. However I focused purely on the frontend to complete this assignment. Although this appliction does feature a backend using express, it is not utilized. This is because I used a project boilerplate I created around a month ago. That being said, this application does have potential to expand into something greater, should I choose to work on it.
